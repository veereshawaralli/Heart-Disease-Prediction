# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

It uses the **UCI Heart Disease dataset** (or your custom dataset `heart.csv`).

## 🛠️ Features
- Handles missing values and categorical variables
- Implements Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Generates classification reports & confusion matrix
- Shows feature importance and decision tree visualization
- Easy to run locally with your own CSV file

## 🚀 Getting Started

  git clone https://github.com/veereshawaralli/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
  cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
```
### install dependencies
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the project
```bash
  python main.py
```
### Dataset

You can use your local `heart.csv`
